Top level model if you're running just in Simulink is hil14_test.mdl

Models we put into the NI VeriStand system, as compiled DLLs:
-finj_mdl_demo_v14.mdl
-eng_mdl_demo_v14.mdl
-mantran_mdl_demo_v14.mdl
-veh_mdl_demo_v14.mdl

Also, there is a auto transmition model that we compile and can swap out: tran_mdl_demo_v14.mdl
